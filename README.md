Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Body Mass Index (BMI)
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the development of a predictive model using a dataset containing demographic information, including gender, height, weight, and BMI classifications. The primary objectives are to analyze the distribution of BMI categories, understand the relationships between physical attributes and BMI, and build a model to predict BMI classifications.

Key Components:
- Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and initial data checks are performed to understand its structure and contents.

- Data Exploration: Summary statistics and visualizations are generated to analyze the distribution of height, weight, and BMI classifications. This includes pie charts and count plots to visualize the distribution of BMI categories.

- Class Mapping: BMI index values are mapped to corresponding classification labels such as 'Obesity', 'Normal', and 'Overweight', enhancing the dataset's interpretability.

- Predictive Modeling: A predictive model is developed using machine learning algorithms to classify BMI categories based on the input features (height, weight, and gender). Model such as Logistic Regression are evaluated for performance.

- Model Evaluation: The performance of the predictive model is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring the model's effectiveness in predicting BMI classifications.

- Visualizations: Various plots, including box plots and scatter plots, are created to visually represent the relationships between gender, height, weight, and the predicted BMI classifications.

- Libraries Used: The analysis utilizes popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

This project provides insights into the BMI distribution within the dataset and demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for predictive modeling in health-related data analysis.
